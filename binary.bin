    Although the alchemists' fundamental goal of elemental transmutation was flawed,
on a deeper level the work of alchemy (cloaked in allegorical images) also
represented the transformation of the soul. Modern science has accomplished the
transmutation of elements using means that the alchemists never dreamed of.
And there is still a small group of occult researchers who persist in trying
to continue the work. The documents of alchemy make fascinating reading for
historians of science and the esoteric.
