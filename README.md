# HexReader

During the lectures on my C course, one of the assignments was:

- Assignment: Write a binary reader that shows in the screen all bytes organized in the screen. This bytes vector to show the content must be dynamically allocated. The display should be like:

```
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
            ...
```

All other dynamic memory allocations functions can be found in the malloc.h library.

This particular assignment was pretty fascinating to me, first time working with memory allocation concepts and finally applying pointers conceps. After finishing it and validating, I've decided to refactor the code and add some extra functions like display the contents in ASCII format with a flag like `-ascii` or simply `-a`.

## Contents

- []()
